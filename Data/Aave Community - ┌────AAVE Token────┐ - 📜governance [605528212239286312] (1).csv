6.04983E+17,Stani#3346,01/11/2020 8:34 AM,the fees that are going back to the protocol goes to depositors and the burned LEND will be simply used to burn LEND and decrease the LEND total supply,,,

From flash loans, a 0.35% is collected from the loan amount, from which 90% is redirected as extra income for depositors of the protocol and 10% is splitted using the same 20%/80% model of the origination fee. There also exist transaction fees related with the Ethereum Blockchain usage, these fees depend on the network status and transaction complexity.",,,

@Pablo Won't DM you first Hi, I am a long term hodler of LEND. Will we see something specific in 2020 regarding the LEND token governance and voting concept (referring to your WP from Jan 2020)? I am asking because I consider to accumulate more LEND if you guys are top serious on this.

@joeismyname In terms of the total market cap of lend = total insured value might not be concrete as the protocol can be partially insured or even same debt capital insured by multiple times depending on the value of LEND market capitalization. What is interesting is that the incentives are like thrust engines that are adjusted based the need for securing the protocol. These incentives drives adoption for obtaining LEND to secure the protocol since there is incentive (inflation/fee sharing)",,,

@Deleted User No, but to give some insights current phase is phase 0, after this one phase 1 is coming with governance and phase 2 with full tokenomics within the protocol. We will be giving more details when we release the tokenomics and governance documentation. We also released some details on our Ethereal summit presentation, you can find more details in this article:

@rb 
LEND token will be used to govern the protocol, we are currently working on the implementation of the governance apart from this it will be possible to be staked within the protocol to provide security/insurance to the protocol/depositors and that way earn staking rewards and fees from the protocol. Also currently LEND token is burnt based on the fees gathered in the protocol, so holders benefit on the reduction of the supply. We are working to release the specific documentation about tokenomics and governance for more details. Meanwhile this article may be helpful:

LEND token will be used to govern the protocol, we are currently working on the implementation of the governance apart from this it will be possible to be staked within the protocol to provide security/insurance to the protocol/depositors and that way earn staking rewards and fees from the protocol. Also currently LEND token is burnt based on the fees gathered in the protocol, so holders benefit on the reduction of the supply. We are working to release the specific documentation about tokenomics and governance for more details. Meanwhile this article may be helpful:

@URULE @crypton  as the governance is still in the genesis governance/migration steps over the road map, the ability to do updates is still available by the genesis team, for example for highly requested and backed additions/updates as such, but when the full governance protocol is implemented any update or change would require to have its proper validation process over voting etc, here more details:
